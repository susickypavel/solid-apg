`solid-ppg` is a collection of functions (referred to as primitives or builders) developed for the Solid.js library.
It encompasses the logic for crafting accessible UI components while adhering to the WAI-ARIA standard and APG design patterns.

## Installation

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install solid-apg
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install solid-apg
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn install solid-apg
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage

Most of the components is exported in the form of a subpackage. For example, to import and use the `Carousel` component, you would do the following:

```tsx
import { createCarousel } from "solid-apg/carousel";
```

Alternatively, you can import the entire library and use the components directly:

```tsx
import { createCarousel } from "solid-apg";
```
